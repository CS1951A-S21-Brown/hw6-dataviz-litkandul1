		<h1>Answers to Written Questions</h1>
		<p> My dashboard answered the questions presented in the dashboard as follows: <br>
			<b>Question 1:</b>Your boss wants to know the number of football games by year.<br>
				This one was answered by the scatter plot that shows the number of games played per
				year between 2011 and 2020. This was a fairly simple question. <br>
			<b>Question 2:</b>Your boss wants to understand the top winning nations. 
				We would like to see a winning percentage for the top 10 nations<br>
				My bar plot showing winning percentages answers this question. I preprocessed the data
				by sorting by team and summing up wins as well as games played.<br> I set the minimum number of 
				games played to be the mean of games played across the dataset and removed any teams that fell
				under this threshold <br>(so we didn't include teams that played few games and won at a high percentage). <br>
			<b>Question 3:</b> Lastly, we are trying to bet on which team will win the world cup 2022<br>
				This question is answered by the interactive bar plot displaying 3 different goal metrics. Some people
				believe that a high powered offense wins championships, <br>so I made a barplot showing the highest scoring
				teams over the last 2 world cups.<br> Some people, myself included, believe defense wins championships. <br>For
				this metric I made a barplot of teams that gave up the fewest goals over the last 2 world cups. <br>
				These two metrics are good but there is a potential for false conclusions because we don't factor in number of games 
				played. <br>To neutralize this, I made a third metric that displays the ratio of goals scored vs allowed. 
				Using these three metrics, we should be able to make predictions. <br>
			<b>Why was D3 helpful?</b><br>
				<b>1.</b> It was helpful because there was a plethora of resources and documentation available for learning it, 
				   making me more motivated to actually implement additional functionality. <br>
				   Especially when compared to something like SQL, this wasn't a terrible experience learning a new language<br>
				<b>2.</b> It was a tool designed specifically for the work we were doing in this project, making it a sufficient library on it's own.<br>
			    <b>3.</b> It is very intuitive in that every type of plot follows a similar pattern in creating and editing the figures with data. <br>
			<b>Why wasn't D3 the best tool></b><br>
				<b>1.</b> As someone with much more experience in Python/matlab, I think I would've been able to do far more with a library like matplotlib <br>
				<b>2.</b> D3 is not nearly as efficient/optimized for calculating statistics compared to Pandas or Matlab <br>
				<b>3.</b> D3 is not as helpful because it makes us create visualizations from scratch, which is not practical in a data science workplace setting<br>
			<b>Question 4:</b> Evaluate the accessibility of your dashboard based on the readings in the “Before you begin” section. 
				What kinds of users might find this dashboard accessible and who might have more difficulty? 
				What additional actions might you take to make this dashboard more accessible to all audiences?<br>
				I believe I took many steps to ensure my data dashboard was accessible to a variety of users. As we saw in the <i>Inclusive Design</i> article, it
				helps to include whitespaces between figure elements. Notice how I did this in my bar plots. Further, I went on the given link and choose
				colors that are easier for colorblind people to see. Also, I made sure to include alt texts for my graphs to give some additional information
				regarding the preprocessing and the information on the figure. One thing I could've done better was to include the number of games played as a text 
				over each scatter plot point. The fact that to get the exact number requires a hover might make it harder to work with some assistive technologies. 
				Next time I will make sure to fix that. So, people who are colorblind (hopefully) would have an easier time using this dashboard while people 
				using assistive technologies may not have as easy of a time. <br>
			<b>Question 5:</b> Reflect on the stages of your design and implementation process when you could have taken steps to make your
			dashboard more accessible to all audiences. What are some factors that kept you from taking these steps? <br>
			I think going through my dashboard I was able to take numerous steps to make it accessible to all audiences. As I mentioned in question 4, I failed to add
			text over each scatter plot point that would allow people using assistive technologies to avoid having to hover over the data point to get the exact value.
			I think there are other things I could've implemented such as a legend for my coloring schemes in the bar plots. I also maybe could've added even more 
			descriptive titles. Factors that kept me from taking these steps were definitiely time and experience. I didn't have a lot of extra time as this project
			was already fairly intense to begin with. Further, this is my first time working with javascript so some of the additional features seemed daunting in 
			the amount of time it'd take me to understand how to use them.
